## ⚙️ Configuration

The plugin creates two configuration files in the plugin folder after the first run.

### 1. `config.json`
Change the global prefix shown before every message.

```json
{
  "ServerNamePrefix": "{lime}HYPERION KZ |"
}
```
### 2. 'ranks.json'
You can create unlimited ranks! The plugin automatically sorts them.

MinCount: How many connections needed.

Title: The rank name.

Color: The color of the rank name.

IsRainbow: Set to true for the rainbow text effect (sorta, it is simply every letter has different colour)

```JSON
[
  {
    "MinCount": 0,
    "Title": "KZ Nub",
    "Color": "{grey}",
    "IsRainbow": false
  },
  {
    "MinCount": 1000,
    "Title": "Strafe God",
    "Color": "{red}",
    "IsRainbow": false
  },
  {
    "MinCount": 3000,
    "Title": "Autostrafer",
    "Color": "{white}",
    "IsRainbow": true
  }
]
```

## 🎨 Supported Colors
You can use these tags in your config files:

{default}, {white}, {darkred}, {green}, {lime}, {red}, {blue}, {gold}, {yellow}, {silver}, {grey}, {purple}, {olive}, {magenta}, {lightred}, {lightblue}.
